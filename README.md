# SMS Spam Detection Using Logistic Regression

This project focuses on detecting spam SMS messages using a Logistic Regression model. By preprocessing the dataset and applying text classification techniques, the project achieved high accuracy in classifying messages as spam or ham.

## Project Overview

- **Objective**: To classify SMS messages as spam or ham using Logistic Regression.
- **Dataset**: SMS Spam Collection Dataset with 5574 messages (87% ham and 13% spam).
- **Model**: Logistic Regression, trained using TF-IDF vectorizer for feature extraction.
- **Outcome**: Achieved an accuracy of 96.59% in identifying spam messages.

## Key Files

- `data (1).csv`: Dataset used for training and testing the model.
- `miniprojectanalysis.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook with code for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- `miniproject report.docx`: Project report summarizing the objectives, preprocessing, and results.
- `SMS Spam Detection Using Logistic Regression.pptx`: Presentation covering key points and findings of the project.

## Results

- **Accuracy**: 96.59%
- **Precision** (spam): 0.99
- **Recall** (spam): 0.75
- **F1-score** (spam): 0.86

## Instructions

1. Open the `miniprojectanalysis.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook to explore the data preprocessing and model training.
2. The dataset (`data (1).csv`) can be loaded into the notebook for model training and evaluation.
